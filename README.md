# simple-registration-form

##This is a simple project using PHP and mySQL to build a registration and login form. 

When you register, your information will be saved in a database and you will be sent an email containing a link. Following this link will activate your account and allow you to then log in with your information. If you log in, you will be greeted with a random sample page and your name. 

I've tried to include a 'forgotten password' page, which will send out a password reset request link and allow you to change the password.
